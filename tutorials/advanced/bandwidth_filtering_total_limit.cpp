 * This file contains a simple distributed application that reads images from
 * a file, monitors bandwidth, and filters images from writes if a bandwidth
 * limit is met (until the bandwidth usage becomes acceptable again)
 * 
 * Windows:
 *   cd %MADARA_ROOT%\bin
 *   tutorial_bandwidth_filtering 0 (in one terminal)
 *   tutorial_bandwidth_filtering 1 (in a second terminal)
 *   etc.

 * Linux:
 *   cd $MADARA_ROOT/bin
