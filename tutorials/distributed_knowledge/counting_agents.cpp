 * @file counting_agents.cpp
 * @author James Edmondson <jedmondson@gmail.com>
 *
 * This file contains a simple distributed application that counts the
 * number of agents that come online. To test the application, launch
 * a number of terminal windows (e.g., on Windows, go to Start->Run
 * and type "cmd" to bring up a terminal). Do this a number of times
 * until you have up to 10 terminals open. Now, in each terminal
 * invoke the compiled terminal by changing directory into the bin
 * directory and starting tutorial_counting_agents with an id.
 * 
 * Windows:
 *   cd %MADARA_ROOT%\bin
 *   tutorial_counting_agents 0 (in one terminal)
 *   tutorial_counting_agents 1 (in a second terminal)
 *   tutorial_counting_agents 2 (in a third terminal)
 *   etc.
 *
 * Linux:
 *   cd $MADARA_ROOT/bin
 *   tutorial_counting_agents 0 (in one terminal)
 *   tutorial_counting_agents 1 (in a second terminal)
 *   tutorial_counting_agents 2 (in a third terminal)
 *
 * If you have done this correctly, you should see the number of current
 * agents and max agents change in your terminal window.
 * 
 * This tutorial also allows for setting a domain. A domain is a partition
 * of the network that allows for privacy amongst a clique of agents. To
 * set the domain for one of the agents, simply pass in a 2nd argument
 * that differentiates the partition. For instance,
 *
 * tutorial_counting_agents 0
 * tutorial_counting_agents 0 secret
 *
 * Creates 2 agents, both with id 0, but communicating separately. The
 * first is communicating in the default domain. The second is communicating
 * in a separate domain called "secret". Neither of these will receive
 * updates from the other agents.
